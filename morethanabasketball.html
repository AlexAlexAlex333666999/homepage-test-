    <h3>Did You Know That Kobe Won... Oscar?</h3>
    <p>While Bryant's name is synonymous with basketball championships and not necessarily Hollywood award shows, he earned his Oscar in 2018. Bryant took home the trophy for best animated short film at the ceremony, along with Glen Keane, who animated and directed the short called "Dear Basketball." It featured music by John Williams, an award-winning composer who worked on "Star Wars" movies, "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial" and several other classics.</p>
    <p>Narrated by Bryant, "Dear Basketball" is a nearly five-and-a-half-minute short illustrating the poem that the Los Angeles Laker wrote for "The Players' Tribune" to announce his retirement in November 2015. With lines like "I fell in love with you / A love so deep I gave you my all / From my mind and body / To my spirit and soul" and "This season is all I have left to give. / My heart can take the pounding / My mind can handle the grind / But my body knows itâ€™s time to say goodbye," it's all about letting go and moving on from the sport that Bryant loved deeply.</p>
